        <p>"Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten." - Neil Armstrong</p>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>In the quest to unravel the mysteries of the universe, science has emerged as humanity's most powerful tool for understanding the natural world. From the smallest subatomic particles to the vast expanse of the cosmos, scientists have tirelessly sought to uncover the fundamental laws governing our reality. Yet, for all its remarkable achievements, science has not been able to conquer the realm of prophecy.</p>
        
        <p>Prophecy, the ability to foresee future events with precision and accuracy, remains one of the greatest enigmas of human existence. While ancient civilizations relied on oracles and divination to glimpse into the future, modern society has turned to science in search of answers. However, despite our technological prowess and sophisticated methodologies, our ability to predict the future remains rudimentary at best.</p>
        
        <p>Neil Armstrong's insightful observation serves as a poignant reminder of the limitations inherent in our scientific endeavors. While we may pride ourselves on our ability to make short-term predictions with relative accuracy, our foresight falters when confronted with the complexities of the long-term future. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</p>
        
        <p>This disparity highlights the inherent uncertainty that pervades our understanding of the world. The future is a vast and unpredictable landscape, shaped by an infinite array of variables and factors beyond our control. While science has provided us with invaluable insights into the workings of the universe, it has not endowed us with the ability to foresee the course of future events.</p>
        
        <p>Our propensity for short-term predictions often leads us to overestimate our understanding of the future. We make forecasts for the coming year with unwavering confidence, only to find ourselves humbled by the unpredictability of events as they unfold. It is a sobering reminder of the complexities of the world and the limitations of our knowledge.</p>
        
        <p>At the same time, our failure to anticipate events on a longer time scale underscores the need for humility in the face of uncertainty. The next ten years hold infinite possibilities, yet our ability to foresee them remains limited. We must acknowledge the inherent unpredictability of the future and approach it with a sense of humility and open-mindedness.</p>
        
        <p>While science has provided us with unprecedented insights into the natural world, it is not a crystal ball that allows us to peer into the future with absolute clarity. Instead, it is a tool that enables us to better understand the present and make informed decisions for the future. As we navigate the complexities of our ever-changing world, let us embrace the uncertainty that lies ahead and approach it with a spirit of curiosity and exploration.</p>
