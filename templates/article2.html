        <h1>I Believe in Seizing Every Heartbeat</h1>
        <p>"I believe every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don't intend to waste any of mine." - Neil Armstrong</p>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>Life is a fleeting journey, marked by the steady rhythm of our heartbeats. Each beat serves as a reminder of the finite nature of our existence. It is a constant, unyielding countdown to our eventual departure from this world. Yet, within this finite span, lies infinite potential.</p>
        
        <p>Neil Armstrong's poignant words encapsulate the essence of living with purpose and intention. We are not merely bystanders in the passage of time; we are active participants, shaping our destinies with every decision we make. To waste a single heartbeat is to squander an opportunity for growth, for connection, for love.</p>
        
        <p>With each beat of our hearts, we have the power to leave a lasting impact on the world around us. We can choose to fill our days with meaningful experiences, to pursue our passions relentlessly, and to touch the lives of others in profound ways. Let us not measure our lives in years, but in heartbeats seized and moments cherished. Let us embrace the rhythm of life and make each heartbeat count.</p>
        
        <p>As we navigate the complexities of existence, let us remember the wisdom inherent in Armstrong's words. Let us not allow the monotony of routine or the distractions of modern life to dull the vibrancy of our souls. Instead, let us approach each day with a sense of purpose and a commitment to live authentically. For in the end, it is not the quantity of our heartbeats that matters, but the quality of the life we lead.</p>
